The city of Veridia was a monument to humanity's triumph over night. A shimmering metropolis of glass and steel, it was perpetually bathed in the soft glow of a billion luminescent panels. Streetlights never dimmed, buildings pulsed with a gentle white light, and overhead, vast energy canopies filtered the sun's rays during the day and cast a synthetic twilight at night. In Veridia, darkness was an archaic concept, a forgotten relic of a primitive past.

For Elara, it was a profound absence. At eighty-seven, she was one of the last living people who remembered the night. She remembered a time when the world truly went dark, and the sky above was not a canvas of filtered gray, but a chasm of velvet black, speckled with diamonds. She remembered the thrill of finding the faint, fuzzy smear of the Milky Way, the graceful arc of the Big Dipper, and the brilliant, red heart of Orion. She had spent her youth charting these celestial patterns, an amateur astronomer in an age when the stars were still visible to the naked eye.

Now, her greatest treasure was a small, dusty box hidden in a locked compartment beneath her floorboards. Inside wasn't gold or jewels, but a relic of a bygone era: a personal stargazing device, a miniature projector that had once been a common household item. Its lens was scuffed, its casing scratched, but she had kept it working with old-world precision, meticulously repairing its tiny components with tools no one else knew how to use.

One evening, her great-granddaughter, a girl named Maya, came to visit. The girl’s eyes were wide with a manufactured curiosity from the omnipresent screens. Elara looked at her and saw the innocence of a generation born without shadows.

“Grandmother, what was it like?” Maya asked, a question she had been told to ask by her history module. “The… night?”

Elara smiled sadly, then her eyes glinted with mischief. “I can do better than tell you,” she said, and she led the girl to the center of the room. She dimmed the wall panels and the floor lights, an act so foreign it felt almost sacrilegious. As the room grew dimmer, Maya’s face filled with confusion.

Elara carefully set the projector on the floor and flicked the switch. A thin beam of light shot upwards, unfurling a holographic recreation of a star-filled sky onto the ceiling. The air filled with a faint, static hum as a vast, silent ocean of stars materialized above them. The constellations she had loved so much—Cassiopeia, Lyra, the Pleiades—blazed into existence, silent and breathtakingly beautiful.

Maya’s jaw dropped. She didn’t speak or move, simply stared at the impossible expanse. A tiny, perfect gasp escaped her lips. Elara watched as the girl reached a tentative hand upwards, as if she could touch the light years away.

In the shimmering, artificial city of Veridia, a single moment of genuine darkness had given birth to a memory. The girl had seen the stars. And Elara, the last stargazer, knew that for a little while longer, the night was not yet lost.
